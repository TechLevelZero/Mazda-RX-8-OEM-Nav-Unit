# OpenAuto Pro software ($29.99)

This is what i am using for my headunit as it as some extra features reverse camera, hands-free and OBD II monitoring, and alows for android auto too!

This does require a dongle for CarPlay and Android auto.

Although it's not supported and does not have all the features (I.E Auto Connect, handsfree), the Bluetooth adapter Built-in to the pi does work for muisc quite well.
